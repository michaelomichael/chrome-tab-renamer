  <h1>Tab Renamer</h1>
  <p>Right-click in the main content of a web page and choose the "Rename Tab" option.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately you can't right-click on the tab itself yet.</p>
  <p>Perhaps in future we'll have the ability to configure rules here so that a given URL pattern always has a fixed title?</p>
